Razor: Okay, okay, we’ll get an air conditioner …

Riley: I ain’t moving until it manifests.

Razor: You don’t have to be so dramatic!

Riley: Dramatic?! The pizza on the table is still hot!

Razor: So?

Riley: So, I got off work four hours ago.

*Three days later, Riley gets home to find Marrow, Razor and Charli installing a huge unit on the side of the trailer*

Riley: The hell is that thing?!

Razor: It’s our new air conditioner! … and watch your mouth.

Marrow: Well, it’s a swamp cooler to be precise. From army surplus.

Riley: And what’s a swamp cooler?

Charli: Humidity machine.

Riley: That’s it, I’m sleeping naked on the porch.
